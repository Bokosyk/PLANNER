# PLANNER
A daily planner that allows the user to save events for each work hour of the day from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The time blocks change color according to the time of day, with past events being grayed out, present events being highlighted, and future events being lighter in color. User input is saved into local storage upon clicking the save button icon on the right of the text box.
